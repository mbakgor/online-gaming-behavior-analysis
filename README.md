# Online Gaming Behavior Analysis
This project analyzes player behavior from an online gaming dataset, focusing on predicting engagement levels using Random Forest classifiers.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- Random Forest for predictions

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (using `pip install -r requirements.txt` if applicable).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook.

## Key Findings
- Player retention is influenced by playtime, in-game purchases, and session frequency.
- The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of X% for predicting engagement levels.
